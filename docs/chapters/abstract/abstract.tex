\begin{abstract}
This research addresses a critical billing inefficiency in \faasxlong{} environments, whereby \faas{} functions are charged for allocated resources and execution time whilst awaiting I/O operations, such as network requests. By leveraging code generation and applying an adaptive splitting strategy, existing \faas{} functions can be automatically split around asynchronous I/O operations, such that the resources allocated during idle periods of time are released back to the serverless runtime. For the set of studied OLAP workloads deployed to AWS using Lambda, and a set of wrapper services around HTTP and PostgreSQL, this resulted in a cost reduction of around 70\% when using the adaptive split strategy, and up to 80\% when manually tuning the splitting strategy. Additionally, this research highlights key areas that cloud providers need to address in order to enable customers to fully leverage these types of cost reductions in OLTP workloads, whose billing is typically dominated by invocation costs as opposed to duration costs.
