\begin{abstract}
This research aims to address a critical billing inefficiency in \faasxlong{} environments, whereby \faas{} functions are charged for allocated resources and execution time whilst awaiting I/O operations, such as network requests. Through developing a novel serverless runtime, this research intends to allow function invocations to release unused allocated resources back to the runtime such to be reallocated to other functions, and more accurately billing \faas{} functions for their actual usage.
