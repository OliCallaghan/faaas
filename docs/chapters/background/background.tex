\section{AWS Lambda}

AWS Lambda is by far the most popular \faas{} platform used by developers to deploy code.

\subsubsection{System architecture}

The AWS Lambda system architecture is centered around the concept of Firecracker MicroVMs\cite{firecracker-microvm}.

\subsection{Concurrent executions}

Each invocation of a lambda function executes independently inside of it's own Firecracker MicroVM, in what is known as a slot.

Each MicroVM provides a slot which can handle a single invocation, however once this invocation completes, the slot can be used by another invocation.

\subsection{Pricing structure}

Billed for execution time from start to finish, since a MicroVM is provisioned the entire time.
