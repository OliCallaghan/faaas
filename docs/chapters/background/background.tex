\section{AWS Lambda}

AWS Lambda is by far the most popular\cite{eismannReviewServerlessUse2020,StateServerlessDatadog} \faas{} platform used by developers to deploy serverless applications.

\subsubsection{System architecture}

The AWS Lambda system architecture is centered around the concept of Firecracker MicroVMs\cite{agacheFirecrackerLightweightVirtualization2020}.

\subsection{Concurrent executions}

Each invocation of a lambda function executes independently inside of it's own Firecracker MicroVM, in what is known as a slot.

Each MicroVM provides a slot which can handle a single invocation, however once this invocation completes, the slot can be used by another invocation.

\subsection{Pricing structure}

Billed for execution time from start to finish, since a MicroVM is provisioned the entire time.

\section{V8 and the Event Loop}
\label{sec:js-event-loop}

\todo[inline]{Outline the ins and outs of how event loops work. Also need to discuss re: function continuations.}

\section{Continuations and Continuation Passing Style}
A function continuation is a concept in programming\cite{sussmanSCHEMEInterpreterExtended1975}, reified as a datastructure encapsulating an execution state, and a function pointer that can be called to resume execution. They are used extensively across many languages, for example, they form the underpinnings of Rust's Futures API.
