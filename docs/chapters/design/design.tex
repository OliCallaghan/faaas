\section{Developer Considerations}
In alignment with the ethos of \faas{} whereby developer time is spent focusing on the business logic of their application rather than the infrastructure, the design of \faaasc{} should be such that it is easy to use and requires minimal developer effort to leverage the benefits of function splitting.

Since the primary code target of \faaasc{} is JavaScript (and by extension TypeScript) serverless functions, specifically ES6 syntax, \faaasc{} should be designed such that it integrates with existing tooling to deploy to \awslambda{}, specifically Serverless\cite{serverless-cli}.

\section{High-level Design}
The core principal underpinning the design of \faaas{} is to decompose each \faas{} invocation into as a set of function continuations. Similarly to how event driven runtimes such as \js{} handle continuations of asynchronous code with an event loop as described in Section \ref{sec:js-event-loop}, \faaas{} takes advantage of function splitting (via code generation) and message passing to register continuations to be executed with a continuation context.

\section{Splitting Directive}

To reduce developer effort adapting existing functions to support function splitting, a custom directive is introduced into the function handler body, \verb|'use async'|. The purpose of this directive is to indicate to the \faaasc{} compiler that the function handler body should be split into multiple functions at this point, each of which is executed in separate \awslambda{} functions.

This splitting directive draws inspiration by the \verb|'use strict'| directive in JavaScript, which indicates that the code should be executed in strict mode. The \verb|'use async'| directive is a pragma that is not part of the JavaScript language, but is understood by the \faaasc{} compiler. Therefore as a result, unless the \faaasc{} compiler is used, the directive will be ignored by the JavaScript runtime, and so the same code can be run on any other \faas{} platform without modification.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[obeytabs=true,tabsize=2]{javascript}
export async function handler(_) {
  "use async";
  const foo = await bar();
}
\end{minted}
\caption{Example usage of the directive.}
\label{listing:use-async-simple-example}
\end{listing}

Immediately following the \verb|'use async'| directive, it is expected that a variable declaration is made and initialised to the resolved value from a promise constructed by calling a function, as seen in Listing \ref{listing:use-async-simple-example}.

\section{Capturing Scope}

Since from the developer's perspective, the function handler body is a single function, the \faaasc{} compiler must capture the scope of the function handler body at the point of the \verb|'use async'| directive. This is achieved by parsing the function handler body into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and capturing any uses of now free variables beyond the split point.

This scope is captured into a serialized context, and stored so that the continuation can be executed with the correct scope. The continuation is invoked when the async request is completed.
